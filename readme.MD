# SHA-47 Geo-Tagging System

## Hackoverflow 2.0 Project

Team SHA-47 Geo-Tagging System, developed for the Hackoverflow 2.0. This comprehensive system aims to enhance public safety and streamline law enforcement efforts by geo-tagging privately owned surveillance cameras.

## Problem Statement

### Overview

Private surveillance cameras are crucial for public safety, but the lack of standardized geo-tagging poses challenges for law enforcement. The SHA-47 Geo-Tagging System addresses these issues by providing a user-friendly interface for camera owners, standardized metadata, secure data storage, and seamless integration with existing surveillance networks.

Here are some project snapshots -
